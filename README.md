```
85% of customer websites** experiencing significant performance degradation or complete downtime.
Loss of transactional data** for 30% of the active users during the downtime period.
Reduced customer trust and potential financial losses**.
```

## Timeline

**July 15, 2024**

- **13:45:** Monitoring system triggered alerts due to elevated error rates and failed database connections across multiple customer websites. The IT team began investigating potential causes, initially suspecting network issues or increased traffic load.

- **14:00:** Preliminary analysis indicated that the primary database server was unresponsive, leading to a large number of failed connections. The team switched focus from network issues to database health and integrity.

- **14:20:** IT team confirmed that the primary database server had crashed due to an unexpected hardware failure. An attempt to initiate an automatic failover to the secondary database server failed, exacerbating the downtime.

- **15:00:** The team initiated a manual failover process to the secondary database server to restore service. Efforts were made to recover lost transactional data, but initial assessments indicated data loss for some active users.

- **17:30:** The failover process was completed, and the secondary database server was successfully brought online. Affected websites began to come back online, although some users continued to experience degraded performance.

- **18:00:** The team started an extensive review of the primary database server to assess the hardware failure and develop a plan for recovery. Investigation revealed that the failure was due to a combination of an outdated firmware version and a failing disk array.

- **20:00:** The primary database server was repaired and brought back online as the new secondary server, with the previous secondary server taking over as the primary.

- **21:00:** The IT team conducted a comprehensive check to ensure all services were running smoothly and confirmed that no further data loss was occurring.

## Root Cause Analysis
``` The root cause of the incident was a critical hardware failure in the primary database server, specifically related to an outdated firmware version and a failing disk array. The lack of a robust failover mechanism and proper redundancy in the database infrastructure contributed to the prolonged downtime. ```

## Contributing Factors
- **Outdated firmware:** The primary database server was running on an outdated firmware version that contributed to the hardware failure.
- **Inadequate failover mechanism:** The automatic failover process was not properly configured, leading to a delay in switching to the secondary database server.
- **Insufficient monitoring:** There was insufficient monitoring of the health of the database serverâ€™s hardware components, leading to an undetected failure.

## Resolution and Preventive Methods
- **Hardware upgrade:** The affected database server's hardware components were upgraded, and the firmware was updated to the latest version to prevent future failures.
- **Enhanced failover configuration:** The failover mechanism was thoroughly tested and reconfigured to ensure a seamless transition in case of future incidents.
- **Improved monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring tools were implemented to track the health of hardware components, allowing for early detection of potential failures.
- **Data backup improvements:** Data backup procedures were revised to include more frequent backups and faster recovery options to minimize data loss.
- **Customer communication:** Customers were informed of the incident and its resolution, with recommendations for those affected by data loss.

> Regular infrastructure audits and robust disaster recovery plans are crucial to maintaining website reliability. Proactive maintenance and timely upgrades of hardware and software components are essential for preventing similar incidents.
